# DeStrangify

This is an android application that implements augmented reality to view a set of points on the camera that corresponds to 
different (last seen)locations of the users that are using that are using this app and are in the vicinity of the user under
concideration.

I have used parse.com for my cloud requirements, but I might move it in to my own server if I could afford one later. Any
suggestions to improve AR are welcomed.
